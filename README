Environment: CLion, Ubuntu 22.04
How to compile the project:
    Type 'make'
Example of how to run the project:
./oss -n 4 -t 3 -i 1
I had some issues with headers and error handling. Pasting my source code with the output from the make command ChatGPT provided the appropriate headers and found small syntax issues
